## Casual notes

Now I've divided the events which I may encounter in daily life into several categories:

#routine, inlcude **morning/before bed routine**, cleaning, laundry etc.
#work, inlcude evey things that I can not learn from
#study, include all the events that make me learn something new
#ent., include watch movies or drama
#misc.
#weakness, include all the bad habits I have and record the time I spend on them

I can make a sheet to record all the events, like

| #weakness | Time | #work | Time | #study | Time | #ent. | Time | #routine | Time | #misc. | Time |
|-----------|------|-------|------|--------|------|-------|------|----------|------|--------|------|


Finally I think this is better:

| Categories | Events | Time |
|------------|--------|------|
