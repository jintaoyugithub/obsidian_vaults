## Personal TODO Lists

Check the [[TODO-Main]] list for more info!

- [~] diligentEngine framework (TA first)

## Casual notes

现在感觉我每天记得东西多余的琐屑了，我想之后改进一下，放弃记录日常的一些事情，比如吃饭，洗澡。最好能总结成几个大类，这样在写脚本的时候也好归类。

目前想到的:

#routine, inlcude **morning/before bed routine**, cleaning, laundry etc.
#work, inlcude evey things that I can not learn from
#study
#ent.
#misc.
#weakness

### Meeting notes

Calle offer us serval solutions:

- [>] Ray marching + Velocity Field + Height map of a terrain

- [x] Particle system + Velocity Field + Ray Marching

Optimizations:

- velocity field: low resolution + noise and then sample
- ray marching
- two velocity maps, one is vertical and one is horizontal

- [~] Particle system + Smooth Particle Hygrodynamic + Fluid simulation

### Road map

1. Particle system + Rneder target

2. Ray marching volumetric fog(optional), make particle system looks better + flowmap(velocity field, two dimention)

3. interation(mouse)

3. Combinition

Possible Master thesis topics:

1. volumetric rendering(ray marching) and intergrated into our interaction system

2. optimization on performance

3. fake sph
