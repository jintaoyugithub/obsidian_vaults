## Mandatory Schedules

- [x] Morning Routine 
    - [x] Wash up
    - [x] breakfast
    - [>] walk out for 10 min (optional)

- [x] visit activision(king)
- [ ] assignment 4 TA
- [ ] email
    - [ ] email Calle and Gunter about latest update of out project
    - [ ] roadmap to gunter
    - [ ] mention game companies and master thesis, IO ish and Frostbite, DICE(no paid)

## Personal TODO Lists

Check the [[TODO-Main]] list for more info!

- [ ] diligentEngine framework (TA first)

## Study notes

### Meeting notes

Calle offer us serval solutions:

- [>] Ray marching + Velocity Field + Height map of a terrain

- [x] Particle system + Velocity Field + Ray Marching

Optimizations:

- velocity field: low resolution + noise and then sample
- ray marching
- two velocity maps, one is vertical and one is horizontal

- [~] Particle system + Smooth Particle Hygrodynamic + Fluid simulation

### Road map

1. Particle system + Rneder target

2. Ray marching volumetric fog(optional), make particle system looks better + flowmap(velocity field, two dimention)

3. interation(mouse)

3. Combinition

Possible Master thesis topics:

1. volumetric rendering(ray marching) and intergrated into our interaction system

2. optimization on performance

3. fake sph
