# week-two

## Goals

- [ ] Research on compute shader tessellation
- [ ] DirectX 12 compute shader
- [ ] DirectX 12 Mesh shader (might be next week goal)
- [ ] Goal document

## 1.20

- [ ] check [[week-one_2025-01-13#^paper1141]]
- [ ] background of goal doc

### Misc

another solution for approach nanite level mesh which means high dence/fidility meshes

most of the game resources are handcraft instead of megascan

best I can do I think it's intergrate compute shader with the mesh shader pipeline

final decision: 
1. compute shader based tessellation
2. how to fit this stage into the mesh shader pipeline
3. or to traditional rendering pipeline but without the hardware tessellation stage

- **pros.**

1. more flexiable to used in mesh shader pipeline and ray tracing shader
2. no limits of number of subdivision compare to the hardware tessellation
3. faster tessellation because of differenct tessellated algo.

- **cons.** 

1. if we used a threshold to control the tessellation level, will it cause wired transition?
2. nanite tessellation has artifacts, check tessellation part of [[#^blog1201]]

- **possible prototype methods**

1. directly used a high dence geometry in the engine, and see the performance
2. get the simplify version + displacement map in zbrush for example, and use tessellation to get the same number of vertices and see how is the performance
3. performance comparision between hardware tessellation and compute shader tessellation

- **future work**
1. software rasterizer to improve the performance when the size of triangle is less than a pixel
