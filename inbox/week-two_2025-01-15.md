# week-two

## Goals

- [ ] Find different tessellation/subdivision algo.
- [ ] DirectX 12 tutorial
- [ ] Falcor rendering framework 
- [ ] Goal document before Friday

## 1.20

- [>] check [[week-one_2025-01-13#^paper1141]]
- [x] mesh shader pipeline
- [x] common mesh optimizer

### Misc

another solution for approach nanite level mesh which means high dence/fidility meshes

most of the game resources are handcraft instead of megascan

best I can do I think it's intergrate compute shader with the mesh shader pipeline

final decision: 
1. compute shader based tessellation
2. how to fit this stage into the mesh shader pipeline
3. or to traditional rendering pipeline but without the hardware tessellation stage

- **pros.**

1. more flexiable to used in mesh shader pipeline and ray tracing shader
2. no limits of number of subdivision compare to the hardware tessellation
3. faster tessellation because of differenct tessellated algo.

- **cons.** 

1. if we used a threshold to control the tessellation level, will it cause wired transition?
2. nanite tessellation has artifacts, check tessellation part of [[#^blog1201]]

- **possible prototype methods**

1. directly used a high dence geometry in the engine, and see the performance
2. get the simplify version + displacement map in zbrush for example, and use tessellation to get the same number of vertices and see how is the performance Mesh shader tessellation
3. performance comparision between hardware tessellation and compute shader tessellation

- **future work**
1. software rasterizer to improve the performance when the size of triangle is less than a pixel

## 1.21

- [x] hardware tessellation overview
- [x] gpu turing arch. overview
- [x] gpu fermi arch. overview
- [>] figure out how compute shader based tessellation fit in mesh shader pipeline
- [>] background of goal doc 

### Misc

The title of this project could `GPU-driven software tessellation`, `software tessellation in latest rendering pipeline` such as **ray tracing pipeline** and **mesh shader pipeline**

#master-thesis-ideas To evaluate the performace of software tessellation to different rendering pipeline, like traditional, mesh shader, hardware ray tracing etc., we could have different solutions for each pipeline.

1. to traditional rendering pipeline: because compute shader doesn't really fit in this pipeline, so alternative, we use compute shader to tessellate mesh and write all the mesh data back to graphics buffer such as vertex buffer of ssbo.

Is it possible to skip the hardware tessellation stage if we just don't have tcs and tes shader, otherwsie it will affect the performance of the compute shader based tessellation.

2. to mesh shader pipeline, we just need to implement the subdivision algo. in the mesh shader, and directly send the data to the rasterizer, then we can use that to compare the performace of the mesh shader based tessellation.

#master-thesis-solutions *meshlet level tessellation? + displacement mapping* to achieve nanite level high dence models

and if we can replace the hardware rasterizer in the pipeline, we might be able to render pixel size triangle in a very efficiency way!

I can use the same subdivision algo in the hardware and compare the performance, and then use a more efficient algo when we have a very specific scenario  

#master-thesis-challenges meshlet level tessellation will cause detail gap amount meshlet which are connected but has different tessellation level

may be we can reference the solution which introduced by [[week-one_2025-01-13#^blog1131]]


3. or can we skip the input assembler stage and the hardware tessellation stage, directly send the mesh data from compute shader to the vertex shader.

But these solutions will be affect by the other stages in the pipeline, so it's hard to only compare


## 1.22

- [x] check [[week-one_2025-01-13#^paper1141]]
- [>] background and related work of goal doc
- [x] play around with Falcor, big pic of how it works
- [>] how falcor load models and textures, it seems like it use python file to load the models
- [x] directx mesh or meshoptmizer

### Misc

Might be the possible #master-thesis-solutions with mesh shader pipeline:

1. first we got a high-fidility models in DCC tools or onlinw 
2. then we make a simplify version of it (less triangles) and with displacement map
3. load the simplify version of the model into `Falcor`
4. write possible [[falcor-overview_2025-01-22#render-pass]] and group them into a [[falcor-overview_2025-01-22#render-graph]]

`meshlet level culling pass` -> `meshlet level tessellation pass` -> `GBuffer pass`(if we are using deffered shading) -> ...(could be `PathTracer pass`, `DLSS pass`) -> `Accumulate pass` 

Currently directx mesh shader example only have dynamic lods at **mesh level** not meshlet level

one of the biggest #master-thesis-challenges might be how to deal with the edge tessellation with connected meshlet in order to avoid **lod cracks**


Ray tracing pipeline solution? Bonus!!!!!

The **size of the obj file** which processed by the `DirectX mesh` will increase!

original monkey.obj `18719KB`
processed monkey.bin `33793KB`

!!! Fail to let `direct x sample mesh shader` to render the monkey head from blender because the this directX require a certain vertex layout.

**Mesh shader file expects a certain vertex layout; assert our mesh conforms to that layout**

looks like it has a very specific way to load model which has been processed as meshlet.

`meshlet level tessellation gonna be super hard!!!!!!`

## 1.23

- [x] find papers about different subdivision algo.
- [x] prototype possible methods
- [ ] possible challenges about meshlet level tessellation
- [ ] possible scenarios
- [ ] goal document

### Misc


#master-thesis-solutions Different ways to prototype:

goal -> nanite level details mesh

1. simple subdivision algo based on compute shader + traditional rendering pipeline + compare to the hardware tessellation

2. simple subdivision algo based on mesh shader + mesh shader rendering pipeline + comparision 

3. if 2 is possible, complex subdivision algo based om mesh shader + mesh shader rp + comparision, if 2 is not, complex subdivision algo based on compute shader + comparision


**how to compare?**

directly load high fidility models into the scene, on the otherhand, get the simplify version and the displacement map of the same high-fidility models, use the tessellation method we provide to reach the same level/numbers of vertices/triangles, and to see how is the performace.

#master-thesis-challenges of meshlet level tessellation:

`two connected meshlets might have differenct tessellation level (or different lods)`, in mesh shader pipeline, all the models which fit in mesh shader **are required to be processed into different meshlet** and LODs are fixed, like we need to manually split different lod of the same mesh into meshlets and **we could dynamically select lod but not in meshlet levels, in whole mesh level**

That will lead `lod cracks`!!!!

For current mesh shader pipeline, dynamically select meshlet level lods is bascically impossible! Check [[week-one_2025-01-13#^blog1131]], nanite has a solution for `Run-time view dependent LOD selection` and `LOD cracks solution`, but definitely I  don't have the ability to reproduce that! 

For `RTX mega geometry`, we better wait for the RTX 50 seris

>So I could only focus on fixedseries meshlet level of details, mind the tessellation inside each meshlets

Insteal of tessellation, `compute shader + indirect draw + pre-processed meshs`
