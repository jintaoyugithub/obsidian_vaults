# Week one

## Goals

- [x] Determine the thesis proposal -> virtualize geometry
- [ ] Draft goal doc before Wednesday
    - [x] background *
    - [ ] goals of this project
    - [x] related works *
    - [ ] methods -> how I gonna try to achieve the goals
    - [ ] expection of this project
    - [x] references
- [ ] Final goal doc before the end of this week
- [ ] To be continued...

## 1.13

- [x] find references about the two proposals
- [x] quick get through two proposals
- [>] quick go through [[#^blog1131]]
- [>] review the data structure and algo of tree 
- [x] orgnize all references

### Misc

key concept in both proposals: `clusters/meshlet`

1st: geometry cluseter data streaming
2nd: cluster tessellation with compute shader

both of the proposals are trying to increase the fidelityof the models.

- **1st proposals**

Goal?
1. geometry memory management in GPU

gpu driven rendering and meshlet/clusters

dynamic load clusters and corresponding lod

tree cut will tigger lod crash, check DAG

2. condiderable success rate of predicting the necessary geometry every frame

`possible process`: 

>cluster determination -> cached the cluster -> culling -> rendering

will HGB works? like HZB

can we determine the cluster with the help with virtual texture? or with a "lowest resolution" cluster?

check the **streaming part** in the [[#^blog1131]]

3. continuous lod?

nanite is still based on discrete lod levels but at meshlet level

nanite has a new way to handle occlusion culling of the clusters.

- **2nd proposals** 

too many drawcalls in hardware tessellation compare to using compute shader

nanite optimize this process that's why it need a separate pipeline

Offline Decimation algorithms to optimize the topology of the industry standard mesh? 

## 1.14

- [x] review tree ds and algo.
- [~] check [[#^paper1141]]
- [>] carefully read [[#^blog1131]] and take notes
- [x] finish background and related work part of the goal doc

### Notes

[[note-nanite-presentation_2025-01-14|note-nanite-presentation]]

### Misc

smallest streamable unit?

check the `simplification at group` level as well as `streaming` in [[#^blog1131]] 

visibility buffer in deferred shading, check [[#^paper1142]]

## 1.15

- [x] review graph ds and algo.
- [x] relation amount gpu driven pipeline, mesh shader pipeline and virtualize geometry
- [>] other parts of the goal doc
- [x] orgnize all the references

### Misc

gpu-driven pipeline is basically try to free the cpu from some tasks, and let the gpu to decide. 


mesh shader try to remove the fixed-function vertex processing and input assembly in the hardware

if meshlet is required in the mesh shader, mesh separation is needed (manually?) when feed the data to the pipeline based on mesh shader

mesh shader pipeline invole meshlet because size of the work groups are relative small,, meshlet allow these groups only working on part of the mesh

>so I assume mesh shader pipeline doesn't take care of how the meshlet is loaded into the gpu memory?

the meshlet in the mesh shader pipeline is differ from which in the  virtualize geometry
in mesh shader

hardware virutal memory management(hvmm)?

hvmm can't solve the on-demand texture loading, but it optimize the underlying memory management

is it possible to make virtual geometry hardware indepent?

`Question?`

in mesh shader pipeline, shader group will determine which part of the mesh they want to preocess, like for example, one want to take these vertices data, one want to take those.

if we don't do any preprocess, we will still send the all the geometry data to the gpu.

but in virtualize geometry, we care what kind of data should send to the mesh shader, in virtualize geometry, we are the one who cut mesh into pieces/meshlets and determine which should send to the mesh shader.

**amplification shader** try to replace the hardware tessellators?

what's the invocation part of my project if nanite has basically done everything?

when does nanite generate the lod tree for the specific meshlet? before we actually render anything?

is there a mesh conversion from traditional mesh to nanite mesh, which means cut the original mesh to differenct meshlets.

what about the first time when we try to rendering the scene, like the first frame?

mesh split or meshlet generation is performed in CPU side not GPU side.

`limitations of nanite`
1. can not be used in deformable mesh
2. extra overhead when importing the mesh and enable it into nanite mesh
3. nanite mesh can't move? why, need to update visibility buffer?

## 1.16

- [ ] figure out the reasons of the limitations of nanite 
- [ ] finish overall goals and method part of the goal doc
