# Usefule Tips

1. Export the asset from unreal engine to somewhere elese

**Right click on the asset** -> **Asset action** -> **Migration**

Note: you can also use this to check the dependencies of the assets.

2. You can create a new **Scene component** to replace the **Default Scene Root** that will hide the icon of the actor if you don't want to have the visualization of this actor in the world.
