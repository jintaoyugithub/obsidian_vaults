# AI system

`Nav mesh`: you can press **p** to disp the nav mesh, just like the img show below

- `Nav mesh bounds volume`: a tool to limit the navigation mesh is generated, ensuring AI will only navigate in that area

- `Nav modifier volume`: block some specific area which is not allowed to go through for AI

`RecastNavMesh-Default`

`NavLinkProxy`: a blueprint class that can make AI jump from a high position

`Navigation Invoker`: used to dynamic generate nav mesh4, useful in games which has large maps

`Avoid system`: 

- RVO Avoidance: when ai character are too close to each other, the character will push the other characters off to other directions

- DetourCrowdAIController: A blue print class, you need to change the ai controller class in the character


## Questions

1. How to dynamic update nav mesh?

**Project settings** -> search for **Runtime** -> **Runtime generation**

Why we do that? 

For example, we have a ai partner and there is a door, the ai will follow us only when we open the door (that's where we need to change the nav mesh), 比如说你从其他地方进去了，但是ai只能从那里走，所以你必须开门，更新nav mesh让ai通过。
