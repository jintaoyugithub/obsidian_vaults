# Week Five

## Goals

- [x] subdivision surface
- [x] blackwell arch white paper mega geometry part
- [>] draw a triangle with my own vk app
- [/] subdivision part in mega geometry, both theo and code
- [x] tessellation algos in `vk_tessellated_clusters` 
- [/] vk_tessellated_clusters source code
- [x] paper - generic mesh refinement
- [x] paper - flexible kernel for adaptive mesh refinement on gpu
- [>] paper - optimized pattern based adaptive mesh refinement
- [>] paper - efficient gpu rendering of subdivision surfaces using quadtrees (optional)
- [x] cluster-tessellated readme

## 2.10

- [x] Blackwell arch white paper mega geometry part
- [x] check nvvkhl::ApplicationCreateInfo 

### Misc

`nvidia dmm-toolkit` is not supported by the gpu driver after **version 553.64** and vulakn after **version 1.3.2**, because the extension `VK_NV_DISPLACEMENT_MICROMAP_EXTENSION_NAME` no longger supported.

## 2.11

- [x] cluster-tessellated readme
- [x] tessellation table?
- [>] vk_tessellated_clusters source code
- [>] micro triangle data structure in `vk_tessellated_clusters`

`Questions:`

1. What's the relationship between actual triangle and micro triangle in `rtxmega demo`?

They tessellate actual triangle and then tessellate the tessellated base triangle with micro triangle

## 2.12

- [x] subdivision surfaces
- [>] paper - efficient gpu rendering of subdivision surfaces using quadtrees
- [>] paper - flexible kernel for adaptive mesh refinement on gpu

### Misc

`Questions`:

1. Is it possible to represent sharp model with subdivision surfaces?

## 2.13

- [x] paper - generic mesh refinement
- [>] paper - flexible kernel for adaptive mesh refinement on gpu

## 2.14

- [x] tessellation algos in `vk_tessellated_clusters` 
- [x] paper - flexible kernel for adaptive mesh refinement on gpu
