# week-six

## Goals

- [ ] sync mega geometry notes to Coda
- [x] paper - optimized pattern based adaptive mesh refinement using gpu
- [ ] paper - hardware tessellation in real time
- [ ] parametric surfaces
- [ ] paper - efficient gpu rendering of subdivision surfaces using adaptvie quadtrees
- [ ] paper - analytic displacement mapping using hardware tessellation
- [ ] vulkan program

## 2.17

- [ ] prepare the meeting tommorow
- [x] paper - optimized pattern based adaptive mesh refinement using gpu
- [x] fixed function in hardware tessellation

### Misc

`Question:`

1. Does hardware dynamically generated refinement patterns or it is pre-computed?
