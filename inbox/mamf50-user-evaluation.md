# MAMF50 User Evaluation

## Chapter 1

1. Def of `usability`

User can accomplish what they want to do in the way they expect without any obstacles, hesitation or confusion.

2. Properties which a usable product shoud have
- Usefulness: fufill the user's need, requirements and goal

- Efficiency: the speed and the ease level of the taskk

- Effectiveness: enable user to successfully achieve their goal

- Learnability: how quickly and easily the user can learn to use the product

- Satisfaction: the enjoyment and satisfaction when using the product

- Accessibility: the product is useable for people with disablities or in various environments

### **User-centered design(UCD)**

1. why less usable?
- dev. focus on machine or sys not users, e.g. complex controler
- target audiences change from enthusiasts to common users which have little technical knowledge
- hard to design a usable products, hard to fits all users need
- diff team work on their own, nice looking but hard to use
- design doesn't always match implementation

**2. what makes usable/basic principles of UCD?**
- Early focus on users and their tasks
```
Engage users directly with design team throughout the product dev
Team members need to taining on how they interact with users to gather usefule info
collect user feedback systematically instead of some random structure
```

- Evaluation and measurememtns of product usage

focus and invole measureing how user can easily learn and use the product in the early dev.

- Iterated design

iterate based on the user feedback

**3. tech to build usability**

4. attribs that a ucd companies
- ask and test user feedback in the beginning of the dev or the product
- invole diff type of people, designer, engineer, market etc.
- learn as you go, iterate when dev.
- has clear usability goals and objectives


## Chapter 2 - Usability Testing

1. Why test?
- Informing design
- Eliminating design problems and frustration
- Improving profitability

2. Basic test methods

3. Basic elements of usability testing
- page 25

## Chapter 3 - When should test

**1. types of test**
- Exploratory/Formative Study

`Overview`: assess the preliminary prototype by conducting user test and collecting the user feedback 

`When`: Early stage, typically before the functional specifications and design phase begin

`Objectives`: Test if the preliminary design concepts are effective and meets users need


- Assessment/Summative Test

`Overview`: assess the fundamental model by letting user perform some specific taks instead of simple reviewing and commenting

`When`: typically early or midway through the product dev., after establishing the fundamental or hight level design of the product 

`Objectives`: build upon the finddings of Exploratory study, test how effectively the basic model has been implemented, focus on user's ability to perform realistic tasks and identifies specific usability issues. 


- Validation/Verification Test

`Overview`: determine standards -> ask participant to complete specific tasks and collect the data for analysis 

`When`: late in the product dev cycle, close to product's release 

`Objectives`: 
1. evaluated if the product meets the standards which determined previously
2. ensure the issues found at the previously test have been addressed
3. Assess how all the components work together in pratical use


- Comparison Test

`Overview`: participants compare two or more designs and collect the data for analysis 

`When`: Used throughout the whole product dev lifecycle, flexible timing 

`Objectives`: compare two or more designs/products to determine which is more easier to use/learn 

**Note**: the order is usually Exploratory study -> Assessment test -> Validation test

## Chapter 5 - Develop the test plan

**1. What's test plan?**

The test plan addresses the how, when, where, who, why, and what of your usability test.

**2. Why need a test plan?**
- A detailed outline for conducting usability testing, ensuring the testing process is well-defined and organized

- A essential way for diff teams, e.g. design team, developers and management, to communicate, minimizing the misunderstanding and make sure the users' need is addressed

- The test plan define all the internal and external necessary resources to execute the test and make planning more straightforward

- It helps to keep details clear and organized, reminds the team of importanta deadline and milestone

**3. What should a test plan contain?**

- Purpose, goals and objectives of the test

Describe the main focus, specific objectives or problems is not necessary, *research question* will reduce the goals to actual statements.

Execute usability test when it's necessary, e.g.

1. Identify if diff user groups can use the product; 

2. To find out the pinpoint issues and fix that

3. Test if the cur doc is handy to use


- Research questions

Outline the key issues and questions which need answeing, they help guide the testing process and ensure the understanding of the goal

- Participants characteristcs

1. num of participants, not need to have too many participants, 10-12 is the best, informal test, 4-5 is enough

2. sveral small test if resources are tight, iterate the test plan as the test on going

- Test design

Describe how the usability test will be conducted, including the process from the arrival of the participant until they leave

key design:
1. diff groups complete diff tasks, avoid learning from each other

2. fewer participants in the same group to complete all the tasks

3. compare diff version of the product

4. compare diff groupps, e.g. experiences and new

- Task list

including the detailed tasks which the participant should completed during the test

key elements:
1. brief des.
2. necessary materials
3. standards of successfully complete the task
4. time of others standards

- Test environment, equipment and logistics

Describe the test environment and the equipments that the participants will use

- Test moderator role

Clarify what a test moderator will be doing during the test, especially when the participants encounter issues, this part determine the behaviours of the moderator, e.g. when to probing or intervening.

- Data to be collected and evaluation measures

Provide an overview of the types of data you will collect during the test, both *performance data* and *preferenced data* 

**Sample performance/quantities data**: 

1. success rate
2. num and type of prompts given
3. count of all incorrect selections
4. errors of omission
...

**Sample preference/qualitative data**: 

1. record what participant say and think during the test
2. record typical sentences which implies the user preference during the test, e.g. "I like this".
3. how users rate the product and why, e.g. is it userful? match their expectations? overall ease of use? and so on
4. record users' preference between prototypes, ours vs. competitor, old vs. new


- Report contents and presentation

Describe the summary of the test and determine how you intend to communicate the result with other teams.


## Chapter 7

`User profile`: identify and describe the relevant behaviours, skills and knowledge of the person

diff bet. purchaser and end user?

key docs to generate a user profiles:
1. blueprint of the product
2. business requirements doc
3. design arch
4. use case

What's a matrix test design?

Key factors to determine the number of participants
1. relations bet confidence in the result and num of participant
2. avaiable resources
3. if it's easy to invite the type of participant you need
4. time spent on each test session

What's criterion test?
To see if the participant meet the requirements of the expert

Internal participants are valuable resources, they are suitable for exploratory study and *best case* test, which means if they got problems using the product, that means the product has serious problem cause they familiar with the system and know how it works

Be careful with only test the "Best" people

## Chapter 10

**Debriefing teches**
- Replay the test
replay the recorded test session with the participant, let participant provide insights of their actions

- Manual method
take notes during the test and discuss with the participant about their experiences

- Audio record the debrief session

- Reviewing alternate design
participants are shown differnt design and ask their preference
